Bugs/problems:
- Fixed in version 1.1: when running the game for the first time, I noticed the colors of the land cells didn't look very natural, making it harder for the user to guess the correct island. That was because the change of color with
  respect to height was constant (from blue to white). I fixed that problem by adding different color chaning patterns for different sections of height: 
  
  from 0 to 400 units of height (from blue to green),
  from 400 to 500 units of height (from green to yellow),
  from 500 to 800 units of height (from yellow to brown) and
  from 800 to 1000 units of height (from brown to white)

- Fixed in version 2.3: I noticed that sometimes the game wouldn't correctly load on the first opening. I fixed this bug by emptying the list of islands after closing the game window (if that isn't done, upon the next loading the new
  islands might not be higher than the previous highest one, which is why the game doesn't register the new highest island)

- After adding a timer, I noticed that the game would still be running even after closing the main menu window. This was simply because I forgot to stop the timer after closing the game window

- Generally I had a problem with positioning of window elements (buttons, labels, text fields,...), which was fixed by correctly using panel layout modes.

How would I test the projects of other contestants:
I would test if:
- the game can be restarted only after winning or losing
- the click on the water cell is counted as a guess (in my opinion it shouldn't, it's just a user mistake)
- the statistics are properly saved even in some irregular situations (the game is closed in the middle of playing)
- the user isn't allowed to manually change their statistics

Improvements/features I would make if I could in my game:
- Making the game load faster
- Making the user interface look better (adding a better message display and a background image, changing the button sizes/positions,...)
- Adding multiple levels
- Adding more stats (skill level or points which could be used for ranking players)
- Improving existing stats (more precise timer and average guess time calculations)
- Making all the windows resizable (especially the game window)
- Possibility to login as a different player
- Adding a ranking list (using points which would be calculated in some way for every player)
- Not allowing users to manually change their statistics
- Possibility for the user to make their own map and publish it

Some factors that could affect my solution:
- Variable map sizes
- Loading custom made maps
- Making your own maps
- Adding multiple users
